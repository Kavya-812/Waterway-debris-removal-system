# Solar-Powered Water Trash Collector

This project is a solar-powered water trash collector that utilizes ESP8266 microcontroller and is programmed using the Arduino IDE. The trash collector is equipped with a remote XY application that allows it to be controlled from a mobile device.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ESP8266 microcontroller
- Arduino IDE
- Remote XY application

#For component list you can refer to the circuit diagram.

### Installation

1. Connect the ESP8266 to the computer and open the Arduino IDE.
2. Download the code from this repository and open it in the Arduino IDE.
3. Make sure the ESP8266 board is selected in the Arduino IDE under "Tools > Board."
4. Connect the components as shown in the schematic diagram.
5. Compile and upload the code to the ESP8266.
6. Download and install the Remote XY application on your mobile device.
7. Connect the mobile device to the ESP8266 by entering the device's IP address in the Remote XY application.

### Usage

Once the code is uploaded to the ESP8266 and the Remote XY application is installed, the solar-powered water trash collector can be controlled using the mobile device. The collector can be started and stopped remotely, and the conveyor and trash bin status can be monitored in real-time.
